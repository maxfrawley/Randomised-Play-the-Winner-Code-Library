# Randomised Play-the-Winner Code Library
Welcome to the repository for my thesis titled `Investigating the Randomised Play-the-Winner Rule in Clinical Trials`. This repository contains the R code used for the analysis conducted in the following chapters:
- **Chapter 2: Operating Characteristics**
- **Chapter 3: Statistical Estimation and Inference**
- **Chapter 4: Original Investigation into Changing Success Probabilities**

## Overview
My thesis investigated the Randomised Play-the-Winner Rule in clinical trials. The R code provided here corresponds to each chapter, facilitating replication and understanding of the analyses.
-  **Chapter 2:**
    - `Chapter2_Exact_Expected_Values.R` - Implementation of the Exact Expected Values Function, Tables, and 3D Plots, as described in Chapter 2 of the thesis.
    - `Chapter2_Delayed_Responses.R` - Code for the analysis of Delayed Responses as discussed in Chapter 2 of the thesis.
-  **Chapter 3:**
    -  `Chapter3_Asymptotic_Procedures.R` - Asymptotic Procedures Simulations, covering the Non-Centrality Parameter, Expected Treatment Failures, and Asymptotic Variance, detailed in Chapter 3.
    -  `Chapter3_Power_Sample_Size.R` - Empirical Power and Sample Size Calculations discussed in Chapter 3 of the thesis.
    -  `Chapter3_Confidence_Interval_Methods.R` - Large-Sample and Bootstrap Confidence Interval Methods, as explored in Chapter 3.
-  **Chapter 4:**
    -  `Chapter4_Success_Probability_Simulations.R` - Changes in Success Probability Simulations discussed in Chapter 4 of the thesis.
